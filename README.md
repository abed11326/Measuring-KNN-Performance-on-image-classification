# Measuring-KNN-Performance-on-image-classification
This project measures the KNN algorithm performance on an image classification task. It works on an animal image dataset with 3 classes (cats, dogs, and pandas). There exists 1000 images per class. The purpose of the project is to make a baseline to be compare with neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.
